## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using School Performance tables and Ofsted Reports from National Sratistics /gov.uk 2022-23 to better understand:

Question 1: Which shool types have the highest Ofsted rating?

Question 2: Which schools by gender enrolement have the highest Ofsted ratings?

Question 3: Which schools by religious charter have the highest Ofsted ratings?

Question 4: What is the average % of absense for schools that require improvement by Ofsted?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by .gov/uk, so are publicly available here.  All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is a `School Ofsted performance.ipynb` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@adduke.ikr/predicting-excellence-the-hidden-patterns-in-ofsted-ratings-1038ab5d85c0).
