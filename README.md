## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using School Performance tables and Ofsted Reports from National Sratistics /gov.uk 2022-23 to better understand:

1. What are the key factors influencing a Special Measures Ofsted rating?
2. What are the common characteristics of high-performing schools with the highest Ofsted ratings?
3. Are there regional differences in school performance and Ofsted ratings, and what factors contribute to these differences?
4. Whether newer schools performed better in their Ofsted Rating?
5. Can we predict future Ofsted ratings based on current school performance data?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by .gov/uk, so are publicly available here.  All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is a `.ipynb` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@adduke.ikr/predicting-excellence-the-hidden-patterns-in-ofsted-ratings-1038ab5d85c0).
